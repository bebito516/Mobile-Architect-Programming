# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The Scalee application was developed for users seeking to log or monitor their weight by a daily weight input with a goal weight set in mind. The app helps the user stay motivated and consistent with progress charts, goal tracking, and even reminder messaging.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The Scalee Weight log or home screen is the main frame of the whole application. It uses a grid to display a list of weights. From Home Screen, the user has the option to log out from the app as well as the option to input a daily weight. There is also a settings screen that can alter the weight grid displayed on the home screen by deleting or updating dates/ weights.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
The zyBooks has great explanations of the process for the code needed for the app development. The next strategy was utilizing stack overflow for certain portions of the code that I needed help fixing. I could use stack overflow for future reference as most users on the website are experienced coders willing to help beginner coders in development. 

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
After developing a certain portion of the application, I would compile and run the program to test each portion that was created to quickly pinpoint missed or wrongfully input code. 

# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
During the development phase I realized that I couldnâ€™t develop everything on the early design which meant I had to re-innovate the design of the application for better flow and less cluttered design. 

# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Creating a login authentication screen, I utilized my previous skill with the new techniques from this project to create a successfully working login screen. The design layout uses 2 text boxes to intake a username and a password. Then verify if those credentials match any in the database. If they do they allow access to the next screen. The user also has an option to create an account by inputting a username and password into the database.
